# A Cold Winter's Day (Or Night) Using Turing

This was one of the final projects I made in Grade 10 for my computer engineering course. Turing was a bit finicky to work with, but overall, it turned out pretty nicely. Out of all things, I learned about how to implement some threading with this project, as I wanted to make a cursor blink, and could not figure out how!

There is probably a much easier way to do that without the need of threading, but it is pretty cool that I learned something new.

## What's with the weird lights blurring in the night scene?

Tenth grade me was (and is still) really into image processing, so I implemented a very crude box blur in order to simulate the glow of the lights at the train station.
